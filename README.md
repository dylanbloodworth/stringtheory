# Compactifications of Metrics on Heterotic Total Spaces

This directory is the work I completed as an undergraduate researcher with the VT String Theory Group. The research was fulfilled as a requirement for PHYS 4316 (Modern Experimental Physics) which is needed for completion of the BS in Physics.

Here is the <a href="final_paper.pdf" class="image fit">final paper</a>. This was completed as the final assignment of PHYS 4316. The paper was not written with the purpose of being publihsedp; it only provides an outline of the project at an introductory level.

Also included is a <a href="Compactifications of Metrics on Heterotic Total Spaces.pdf">powerpoint presentation</a> that was given the professor of PHYS 4316 and to the String Theory group at the end of the semester.

## Abstract

String theory concerns itself with understanding the fundamental interactions of physics. This considers the compactifications of extra dimensions as well as our current 4-dimensional understanding (referred to as lower dimensions). Much research has shown that different choices for the extra dimensions of space influcence effective lower dimensional equations of Einstein, Maxwell, and Klein-Gordon. To deeply understanding the implications of the extra geometry on the lower dimensional physics, certain metrics and Gauge potentials must be specified for the extra space. Current approaches use machine learning and other numerical methods to approximate Calabi-Yau metrics then use these results to aproximate the Gauge potentials. However, these methods are often sluggish and lead to unwanted error propagation. Therefore, our work has us considering a total metric space that specify forms for our metric and Gauge potentials of interest. Calculating desired information using these techniques reduces error propogation and allows a more streamlined approach to determine the scalar field Ï• and a gauge field strength H.
